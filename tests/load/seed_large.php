/**
 * CLI seed for the enrol_flexaccess JMeter load test.
 *
 * Creates a visible course with a FlexAccess enrolment instance (open, high capacity) and prints
 * the base URL and course id as shell "export" lines for the JMeter plan. Idempotent enough for
 * repeated CI runs (it always creates a fresh course).
