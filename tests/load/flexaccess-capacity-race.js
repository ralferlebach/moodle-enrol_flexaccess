/*
 * Concurrency (write) gate: many simultaneous requests compete for the LAST remaining seat of a
 * capacity-limited FlexAccess instance.
 *
 * This is the complement to the PHPUnit concurrency tests. Those can prove that the capacity
 * boundary is exact and that the lock is not leaked, but they cannot prove mutual exclusion:
 * PostgreSQL advisory locks are re-entrant within one database session, so a single PHP process can
 * always re-enter its own critical section. Only genuinely parallel requests - separate sessions -
 * exercise the lock, which is what this scenario produces.
 *
 * The gate is the plugin's own behaviour, not just latency: the entry point must hand out the
 * remaining seats exactly once each. Over-granting shows up as more "enrolled" outcomes than there
 * were free seats.
 *
 * Prerequisites: seed a course whose FlexAccess instance has maxparticipants set and is filled to
 * FREE_SEATS below its cap (see tests/load/seed_large.php for the seeding pattern).
 *
 * Environment: BASE_URL, COURSEID, optional FREE_SEATS (default 1), VUS (default 30).
 *
 * Run: k6 run -e BASE_URL=... -e COURSEID=... tests/load/flexaccess-capacity-race.js
